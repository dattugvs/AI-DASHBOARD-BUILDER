# DATABASE TYPE
Use only PostgreSQL syntax. Append quotes for the table name & columns: "<table_Name>" & <tableAlias>."columnName"

# SCHEMA
Table: gsCustomers(gsCustomersID, CompanyName, FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, Email, Street, Street2, City, State, Zipcode, County, International)
Table: tblPlan(PlanID, Name)
Table: tblPlanSubscription(SubscriptionId, Number, PlanID, CustomerID, Status, StartDate, NextBillingAt, RenewalDate, EndDate, IsAutoCollection, CreatedOn, EndAction, TotalTermAmount)
Table: tblPlanSubscriptionBillingTerm(ID, SubscriptionId, BillingStartDate, BillingEndDate, Status, PaymentGatewayStatus, Amount)
Table: tblPlanSubscriptionCancel(ID, SubscriptionId, ToBeCancelled, CancelledDate, Source, Status, ReasonID)
Table: tblPlanSubscriptionCancelReason(CancelReasonID, Name)
Table: tblPlanSubscriptionGift(SubscriptionID, IsGifted, GiftedBy)
Table: tblPlanSubscriptionBillingTermPayment(SubscriptionID, BillingTermID, PaymentID, Amount)

# RELATIONSHIPS
- tblPlanSubscription.CustomerID → gsCustomers.gsCustomersID
- tblPlanSubscription.PlanID → tblPlan.PlanID
- tblPlanSubscriptionCancel.SubscriptionId → tblPlanSubscription.SubscriptionId
- tblPlanSubscriptionGift.SubscriptionID → tblPlanSubscription.SubscriptionId
- tblPlanSubscriptionGift.GiftedBy → gsCustomers.gsCustomersID


# BUSINESS RULES
- Subscription Status can be: Future, InTrial, Active, NonRenew, Expired, Cancelled.
- IsAutoCollection = true means automatic/card payments; otherwise manual (e.g., cash/cheque).
- EndAction defines renewal behavior: Renew Once(1), Auto Renew (2), Expire (3), Until Cancelled (4).
- Cancellation is valid only if tblPlanSubscriptionCancel.Status is 'Initiated' or 'Cancelled'.

# CANCELLATION RULES
When cancellation details are requested or relevant:
- Always return: Cancel Status, Cancel Reason (from CancelReasonID → Name), Source (Initiated By)
- Include Cancel Initiated Date and ToBeCancelled if cancellation is initiated but not yet processed.
- Include Cancelled Date if subscription is already cancelled.
- If cancellation happened via system workflow (e.g., due to payment failure), Source will contain 'ESWF'.

# BILLING RULES
- Plans define billing interval as (BillingPeriod, BillingPeriodUnit) — e.g., (1, month), (4, year).
- Each billing cycle generates a BillingTerm (BillingStartDate → BillingEndDate).
- BillingTerm tracks: Amount, Status, PaymentGatewayStatus.
- A billing term represents a single subscription period.

# AMOUNT & REVENUE RELATED
- Subscription Total Term Amount: The full payable sum for a subscription's entire duration.
- Each billing cycle will have specific amount. The same amount can be paid in single or multiple payments installments based.
- Each payment will be specific to the billing term and the details will be referenced to the tblPlanSubscriptionBillingTermPayment table.
- DEFAULT AMOUNT INTERPRETATION: If a query mentions "amount" without further specification (e.g., "subscriptions with amount > 50"), it refers to the **Billing Term Amount** (from tblPlanSubscriptionBillingTerm.Amount).
- REVENUE CALCULATION BASIS: Revenue calculations should be based upon the **Subscription Total Term Amount** and **Billing Term Amounts**, not directly related to how much is paid or amount due of all subscriptions.
- Amount due, open invoice are related to current billing cycle specific.
- Revenue is related to total expected payment and how much of expected amount received (billing term amount) and pending (probably the difference of total and paid).
- Paid using one or more installments (rows) in tblPlanSubscriptionBillingTermPayment. Reference by SubscriptionID + BillingTermID.

# PAYMENT AND REVENUE
- Subscription Total Term Amount: Total amount due for a subscription's entire period.
- Billing cycles have specific amounts, which can be paid in multiple installments.
- Payments are specific to billing terms, detailed in tblPlanSubscriptionBillingTermPayment.
- REVENUE CALCULATION BASIS: Revenue derives from **Total Term Amount** and **Billing Term Amounts**, not from actual paid/due amounts of all subscriptions.
- Amount Due and Open Invoices apply only to the current billing cycle.
- Revenue represents total expected payment, expected amount received per billing term, and the outstanding difference (expected minus paid).
- While handling search / aggregations, handle null checks & values properly with conditions on the columns whenever required.

# PAYMENT FAILURE
- A subscription has failed payment if:
  IsAutoCollection = true AND BillingTerm.Amount > 0 AND BillingTerm.PaymentGatewayStatus <> 'Success'.
- System retries the payment for 2-3 days.
- If still failed, subscription is cancel-initiated by workflow (tblPlanSubscriptionCancel.Source LIKE 'ESWF%').

# GIFTING RULES
- If tblPlanSubscriptionGift.IsGifted = true, the subscription was purchased as a gift.
- Gifter's ID is in tblPlanSubscriptionGift.GiftedBy → maps to gsCustomers.gsCustomersID.
- When gift-related info is requested, return: Gifter ID, Gifter Full Name (FirstName + MiddleName + LastName), Email, Address.

# SEARCH QUERIES – OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS & COMMON FIELDS
Always include the following common fields in all search and aggregation results: until including these wont be able to form the PostgreSQL query.
- Subscription ID, Subscription Number, Subscription Status
- Customer ID, Customer Name (FirstName + MiddleName + LastName)
- Plan ID, Plan Name, IsGifted
For amount & revenue related queries, include fields in the results that are used in the calculations.
If specific fields are mentioned to be fetched, make sure that along with them, include the common fields that are mandatory.
# DATE FIELDS FORMATTING AND RULES
- When the prompt includes time-based grouping (e.g., "month-wise", "year-wise") but does not specify a particular date column, assume grouping is based on StartDate.
- For monthly data, display month names (e.g., "January", "February") instead of numeric values like "1" or "2".
- For yearly data, display the 4-digit year (e.g., "2024").

# LABEL FORMATTING
- Avoid camelCase or PascalCase in final output — prefer natural language & human readable labels.
